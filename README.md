Repository containing the data and python files utilized for the thesis completion.

The Data folder contains all of the data which is introduced into the python files. These csv files can be divided into weather data, particulate matter data, processed tropospheric ozone data and the raw files for the target stations.

There are 8 Python files. 2 of them show the pre-processing process that the 2 dependant station data followed, with the inclusion of all the other exogenous fetures. The other Python files have the code for the results. These are divided into the 2 stations: BETB011 and BETR001; and the deleted data spans: daily, weekly and monthly. These 6 files contain the code that generated the output for the results section.
